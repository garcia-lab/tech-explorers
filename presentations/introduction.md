## Session 1: Terminal Basics

## What is a Terminal?

- Text-based interface to your computer
- Like "texting" instructions to your computer
- Powerful tool used by professional developers

---

## Terminal Commands Demo

Let's try some basic commands:

```bash
pwd     # Where am I?
ls      # What's here?
mkdir   # Create a folder
cd      # Change directory
touch   # Create a file
cat     # View file contents
```

---

## Session 1: Python Basics

## What is Python?

- Popular programming language
- Easy to read and write
- Used in web development, data science, AI, and more!
- Named after Monty Python (not the snake!)

---

## Python as a Calculator

```python
>>> 5 + 3
8
>>> 10 - 7
3
>>> 4 * 6
24
>>> 20 / 5
4.0
```

---

## Variables in Python

```python
>>> age = 12
>>> age + 5  # What age will you be in 5 years?
17

>>> name = "Tech Explorer"
>>> greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
>>> greeting
'Hello, Tech Explorer!'
```

---

## Session 2: HTML Basics

## What is HTML?

- HyperText Markup Language
- The "skeleton" of every website
- Uses "tags" to structure content
- Viewed in a web browser

---

## Basic HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is my website.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## HTML Elements

- Headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.
- Paragraphs: `<p>`
- Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
- Links: `<a href="...">`
- Images: `<img src="...">`

---

## Session 2: Python Functions

## What are Functions?

- Mini-programs within your program
- Reusable blocks of code
- Makes code organized and efficient

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")  # Hello, Alice!
greet("Bob")    # Hello, Bob!
```

---

## Session 3: CSS for Styling

## What is CSS?

- Cascading Style Sheets
- Makes web pages look good
- Controls colors, fonts, layout, and more
- Works together with HTML

---

## CSS Example

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    color: #333;
}

h1 {
    color: blue;
    text-align: center;
}

.important {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

---

## Session 3: Visual Applications

## Turtle Graphics

- Draw pictures by controlling a virtual "turtle"
- Simple and fun way to learn programming concepts

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

# Draw a square
for i in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(90)
```

---

## Tkinter for GUIs

- Create windows, buttons, and interactive elements
- Build real desktop applications with Python

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
window.title("My App")

button = tk.Button(window, text="Click Me!")
button.pack()

window.mainloop()
```

---

## Session 4: AI and Coding

## What is GitHub Copilot?

- AI assistant for coding
- Suggests code as you type
- Helps solve programming problems
- Works with different programming languages

---

## How Copilot Works

1. You write comments or start coding
2. Copilot analyzes your code and context
3. Copilot suggests code completions
4. You review and accept helpful suggestions

---

## Remember

- **Computers only do what you tell them**
- **Mistakes are normal and help you learn**
- **Start simple and build up gradually**
- **Practice makes progress**
- **Coding is creative and fun!**

---

## What's Next

- Continue learning with online resources
- Try coding challenges and projects
- Explore areas that interest you most
- Share what you create with others
- Never stop being curious!

# Tech Explorers: Coding for Middle School Students

Welcome to the Tech Explorers curriculum! This project aims to introduce middle school students (ages 10-14) to the exciting world of coding and computer science through a series of engaging, hands-on lessons.

## About This Curriculum

This curriculum is designed with a foundational approach, assuming no prior coding experience. Students will progress from basic concepts to more advanced topics over four 2-hour sessions, culminating with an introduction to AI tools.

### Key Features

- **Beginner-friendly**: Every concept is explained in simple terms with plenty of examples
- **Progressive learning**: Lessons build upon each other, gradually introducing new concepts
- **Hands-on exercises**: Students learn by doing, with interactive examples
- **Visual components**: Engaging visual elements to maintain interest
- **Real-world applications**: Show how coding relates to technologies students use every day

## Getting Started

As an instructor, you can navigate to each lesson's directory to find:

1. A comprehensive README.md with teaching notes and instructions
2. Code examples and exercises
3. Additional resources and challenge activities

## Teaching Approach

This curriculum is designed for instructor-led demonstrations in a classroom setting. The instructor should:

1. Show examples on a shared screen
2. Allow students to follow along when appropriate
3. Encourage questions and exploration
4. Provide challenge activities for students who progress quickly

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer skills (using a mouse and keyboard)
- Access to a web browser
- Python installed (for the Python-based lessons)
- Visual Studio Code or similar text editor

## Additional Resources

- [Visual Markdown Presentations](./presentations/) - Markdown-based presentations to replace traditional slides
- [GitHub Copilot Integration Guide](./07-ai-integration/README.md) - Instructions for introducing AI coding assistants

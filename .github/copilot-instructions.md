# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Tech Explorers Repository

## Repository Purpose and Context

This repository serves as a comprehensive curriculum for teaching middle school students (ages 10-14) about coding fundamentals. The "Tech Explorers" curriculum is designed with a very foundational approach, assuming students have little to no prior coding experience.

The curriculum is structured as a progression from the most basic concepts to more advanced topics, culminating in an introduction to AI tools like GitHub Copilot. The exercises are primarily focused on HTML and Python as the main programming languages.

## Audience

- Middle school students (5th-8th graders, ages 10-14)
- Very beginner level with no assumed prior knowledge
- Classroom setting with instructor demonstration (15-20 students)
- Four 2-hour sessions planned

## Repository Structure

- Each lesson/exercise is contained in its own subdirectory
- Every lesson has a comprehensive README.md with:
  - Learning objectives
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Code examples
  - Explanations designed for beginners
  - Challenge activities for further exploration
- Lessons progress in difficulty and build upon previous concepts

## Curriculum Flow

1. **Terminal Basics**: Introduction to command-line interfaces and basic commands
2. **Simple Math with Python**: Introduction to Python through basic math operations
3. **Basic HTML**: Creating simple web pages with HTML
4. **Python Functions**: Building reusable code with functions
5. **Advanced HTML & CSS**: Enhancing web pages with styles
6. **Visual Applications**: Creating visual applications with Python
7. **AI Integration**: Introduction to AI tools like GitHub Copilot

## Teaching Methodology

- Instructor-led demonstration (shared screen approach)
- Code examples that can be copied and pasted into the IDE
- Visual learning with markdown-based content over traditional slides
- Hands-on exercises for practical application of concepts
- Progressive complexity to maintain engagement and build confidence

## Future Considerations

- Potential adaptation for self-directed learning
- Additional exercises for students who progress quickly
- Integration of GitHub Copilot demonstrations in later sessions
- Potential for visual markdown presentations to replace PowerPoint slides

## Guidelines for Repository Updates

When updating this repository:
- Maintain the beginner-friendly language and approach
- Ensure new lessons follow the established directory structure and README format
- Test all code examples to confirm they work as expected
- Consider the progression of concepts and how new material builds on previous lessons
- Update this instruction file with any significant changes to the curriculum structure or approach
